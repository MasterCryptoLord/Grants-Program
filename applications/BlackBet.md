  - **DOT**: 12b7sswrKGkst2jFBPcXsFX4K8XcaMGeQvMpsRepsf6wb6ZJ
  - **Payment**: Fiat 04.02.2025, 02:10 UTC

## Project Overview üìÑ

**BlackBet** is the first decentralized crypto casino and betting platform that not only offers traditional casino games but also enables users to create and bet on any event they like. In addition to gaming and custom betting events, BlackBet introduces a unique share ownership model, allowing community members to own a stake in the casino. This innovative solution ensures transparency, fairness, and community-driven growth within a trustless blockchain environment.


BlackBet is an entirely on-chain casino and betting platform where:
1. Traditional casino games (roulette, blackjack, etc.) are **fully decentralized** and **verifiable** on-chain.  
2. Users can **create and bet on any event** (sports, real-world, or user-generated) with transparent payouts.  
3. Community members can own a share of the casino through **on-chain share tokens**‚Äîprofit-sharing and governance occur entirely in a trustless blockchain environment.

No off-chain servers are needed for trust, random number generation (via Chainlink VRF or similar), or bet settlement. Everything is executed and recorded on the blockchain, and users sign transactions from their personal wallets.

---

## Project Components

### 1. On-chain Modules (Runtime Pallets)
- Developed using **Substrate**.
- Manages all logic: bet creation, bet settlement, user balances, casino game outcomes, and ownership tokens.
- Integrates directly with an **on-chain randomness** provider (e.g., Chainlink VRF) for fair game results.

### 2. UI (Decentralized App)
- Built in **React.js**.
- Loaded from a static host or IPFS; no centralized backend server.
- Communicates with the Substrate chain via **wallet RPC** calls. Users sign transactions directly from their wallet.

### 3. Wallet Connection
- Users connect through a **Web3 wallet** (Polkadot.js, MetaMask, etc.).
- All critical actions‚Äîplacing bets, withdrawing funds, buying/selling shares‚Äîare **on-chain transactions** that the user signs locally.

---

## On-chain Modules / Runtime Pallets

### Smart Contract Module Overview
We will develop Substrate pallets that handle:

- **Bet Creation & Settlement**  
  Allow any user to create a custom betting event (e.g., ‚ÄúWill Team X win?‚Äù), accept bets, and settle payouts entirely on-chain.

- **Traditional Casino Games**  
  Implement verifiable on-chain games like roulette, blackjack, etc., using Chainlink VRF or another on-chain randomness provider.

- **Share Ownership**  
  Provide a mechanism for users to purchase, trade, and hold casino ownership tokens. These tokens can be used for profit sharing or governance (deciding platform upgrades, new games, etc.).

#### Publicly Exposed Methods

| Method Name         | Signature                                                               | Description                                                                                            |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **createBet**       | `fn createBet(origin, bet_details: BetDetails) -> DispatchResult`        | Allows a user to create a custom betting event with parameters (outcomes, odds, timeframe, etc.).       |
| **placeBet**        | `fn placeBet(origin, bet_id: u32, amount: Balance) -> DispatchResult`    | A user places a bet on an existing event or casino game, with an amount of tokens.                      |
| **settleBet**       | `fn settleBet(origin, bet_id: u32, outcome: Outcome) -> DispatchResult`  | Concludes a bet with a known outcome; funds are automatically distributed to winners.                   |
| **depositFunds**    | `fn depositFunds(origin, amount: Balance) -> DispatchResult`             | Users can deposit tokens into their on-chain balance for betting and gaming.                           |
| **withdrawFunds**   | `fn withdrawFunds(origin, amount: Balance) -> DispatchResult`            | Users withdraw tokens from their on-chain balance.                                                      |
| **buyCasinoShare**  | `fn buyCasinoShare(origin, amount: Balance) -> DispatchResult`           | Acquire casino ownership tokens directly on-chain.                                                      |
| **sellCasinoShare** | `fn sellCasinoShare(origin, share_id: u32, amount: Balance) -> DispatchResult` | Sell existing casino ownership tokens back to the platform or on an open market.                       |

### Runtime Storage
- **Bets**: Mapping of `bet_id` to event data (creator, odds, status, participants, etc.).  
- **UserBalances**: Tracks each user‚Äôs on-chain balance for betting.  
- **CasinoShares**: Information about ownership tokens, including allocation, transfers, and potential voting rights.  
- **GameConfigurations**: On-chain settings for various casino games (payout ratios, bet limits, etc.).

## Workflow Explanation (Fully On-chain)

1. **User Action**  
   The user interacts with the React.js dApp (e.g., clicks ‚ÄúPlace Bet‚Äù).  
   The dApp prepares a **transaction** to call `placeBet` in the Betting Pallet.

2. **Wallet Signing**  
   The user‚Äôs **Web3 wallet** (Polkadot.js, MetaMask, etc.) prompts for approval/signature.  
   Once signed, the transaction is sent to the Substrate blockchain.

3. **On-chain Transaction**  
   The Betting Pallet processes the request, updates the on-chain storage (e.g., user balances, bet info).

4. **On-chain Response**  
   A **transaction event** is emitted after successful execution (e.g., bet placed).  
   The dApp listens to these on-chain events (via RPC/WebSocket), updating the UI with the new bet status.

5. **Randomness (if needed)**  
   For casino games or bets requiring randomness, the on-chain module calls Chainlink VRF or a similar solution.  
   Verifiably random outcomes are produced entirely on-chain, ensuring fairness.

6. **UI Update**  
   The React.js dApp displays the updated bet status, user balances, or game outcomes in real time.

## Why This Architecture?

1. **Complete Decentralization**  
   - **No centralized backend** to trust for bet logic, random numbers, or user balances. All data and rules live on the blockchain.

2. **User Control & Security**  
   - Private keys remain in the user‚Äôs local wallet. Users sign every critical transaction, removing reliance on centralized servers.

3. **Transparency & Fairness**  
   - Smart contracts/pallets enforce game rules and bet payouts. Anyone can audit the code and verify all transactions on-chain.

4. **Community Ownership**  
   - Share tokens exist entirely on-chain, enabling trustless profit sharing and potential governance.

5. **Scalability & Modularity**  
   - Substrate-based pallets can be upgraded or extended without needing an entire separate backend stack.
